## What can Kubernetes do?

Kubernetes deploys and manages (orchestrates) applications that are packaged and run as containers (containerized) and that are built in ways (cloud-native microservices) that allow them to scale, self-heal, and be updated inline with modern business requirements.

## Orchestrator

A system that deploys and manages applications is known as an orchestrator. It can deploy your applications and respond to changes in real time.

## Containerized Apps

A Containerized app is an app that runs in a container. Kubernetes is used to orchestrate containerized apps. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Docker container images are used most frequently in the industry.

## Cloud Native App

A cloud-native application is an application that supports modern business demands (auto-scaling,self-healing, rolling updates etc.) 

## Microservices App 

A microservices app is a business application that is built from lots of small specialised parts that communicate and form a meaningful application. Each part is called a microservice and each one can be independently developed/maintained.
